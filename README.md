# Road-Damage-Detection
Building a road damage detection system using computer vision techniques. 

This is a research based project. Using YOLO we tried finding pot holes of different categories in the roads. The use of this project will be to create such a classifier that is able to identify road damages that will enable Cars to avoid such potholes and save it from damaging.
